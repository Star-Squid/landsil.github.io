### Portfolio

Please consider this page a learning and showcase project. It will link to some things I'm proud of, projects people can find useful, and also stuff I have to share to be motivated to continue working on.
1. 3 to 5 of my most "interesting" GitHub repositories will be here.
2. Some GitPages pages with markdown (this one), html, and css (TODO)
3. Some "website alternatives" showcase (Notion, Coda, things like that)
4. Some actual external websites with other initiatives

##### You can find me at:
- **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateuszbijakowski)** - I won't reply to anything most likely.
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/Landsil)** - For all of my projects I didn't bother to add here.
- **[Keybase](https://keybase.io/landsil)** - Because I like them

and probably in some other places too
